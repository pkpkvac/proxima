# Overview

In our platform, we value the ability to offer significant customization options to our clients, allowing them to tailor the frontend to their specific needs and preferences. To align with this philosophy, we have designed a coding challenge that tests your ability to create highly customizable React components.

Your task is to develop two distinct React list components, ListA and ListB, each with a unique set of customizable features. These components should demonstrate your skills in creating versatile, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing UI elements using TypeScript, React, and CSS. The challenge is designed to assess your ability to implement functionality that meets our clients' diverse requirements while maintaining a high standard of code quality and design integrity.

## Key Objectives

- **List Components:** Develop two components, ListA and ListB, each showcasing a unique list item.
  - **ListA** should feature a mix of text and images, including titles, descriptions, and images. You have the freedom to decide on the content's specifics, ensuring it's engaging and informative.
  - **ListB** allows for more creativity in content and structure. Design it to be versatile and open-ended.
  - Utilize dummy/example data for both lists. You can use the existing Pokemon utils in the utils folder for fetching data from the PokeAPI, or whatever you wish.
- **Customization Props:** Both lists should accept customization props to allow for significant frontend personalization. These include:
  - `fontFamily`: choice of Inter or Poppins. Both are available on "next/font/google"
  - `headerSize` and `paragraphSize`
  - `backgroundColor`
  - `fontColor`
  - It's crucial these props are well-defined and correctly implemented in your components to ensure flexibility and maintain the UI's integrity.
- **Layout and Design:** Arrange the lists side by side in a responsive layout, ensuring the design adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.
- **User Experience Considerations:** Introduce safeguards to prevent prop selections from disrupting the layout or aesthetics, such as limits on font size.
- **TypeScript Implementation:** Utilize TypeScript to ensure type safety and demonstrate best practices in your code.
- **Styling Method:** Select a styling method that you believe best fits the project, whether it be Tailwind, external stylesheets, inline styles, etc.
- **Documentation and Comments:** Provide essential comments and documentation to explain your design decisions and any unique coding solutions you've applied.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Code Quality:** The clarity, organization, and efficiency of your code.
- **Design and Creativity:** The visual appeal and innovative design solutions of the components.
- **Responsiveness and Layout:** How effectively the side-by-side layout functions and adapts to various devices.
- **TypeScript Usage:** Your ability to leverage TypeScript features for type safety and best practices.

This challenge is an opportunity to showcase your front-end development skills. We're eager to see your approach to creating these components!
